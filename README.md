# ProgrammerEyes

Application written in swift for WatchOS devices. This is App is built with programmer's eyes in mind, or really anyone who uses the computer all day. This program reminds people to follow the 202020 rule, that is every 20 minutes, look at least 20 ft away, for 20 seconds. This unfortuanately is not on the app store as I still haven't decided if I want to purchase a developer's account

used chinese space character to hide titles of modal button thing "　" 
notifications still a bit buggy, gonna do a bit more research, thought it would be same as phone
